This directory contains a cloud app-specific library OS called IX. IX is
designed to run datacenter network services with extremely low network
processing overhead, bounded 99th percentile latency, nearly linear
multicore scalability, and extremely high connection count scalability.

Requirements
============
IX requires Intel DPDK and a compatible Intel NIC (e.g. 82599, X520,
X540, etc). However, future versions of IX will be migrated away from
DPDK and instead include stand-alone drivers.

Setup Instructions
==================

1.) Set up DPDK... Detailed instructions are available here:
http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/guides/intel-dpdk-getting-started-guide.pdf

Here's the quick version...
- unpack and cd to dpdk
$ make config T=x86_64-default-linuxapp-gcc
$ make
$ modprobe uio
$ insmod build/kmod/igb_uio.ko
$ mkdir -p /mnt/huge
$ mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /mnt/huge
$ echo 64 > /sys/devices/system/node/node0/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages

2.) Compile IX...

- cd to the ix directory
$ export DPDK_SDK=<path to dpdk>
$ make

3.) Run IX...
- here are some sample parameters
$./ix -c 1 -n 1
