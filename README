Welcome to the source code repository for BaremetalOS.

The purpose of this file is to provide a general overview of the project
and its organization. Please keep it up to date as you make changes!

The current directory structure is as follows:

bib: A place for storing related work (including PDFs, citations, and
discussions).

doc: Design documents, discussion threads, and experimental results go
here.

nos: The BMOS "libevent" library OS lives here. Currently it is built
on top of DPDK but eventually it will use a custom driver stack and be
built on top of Dune. DPDK is a good temporary solution, but doesn't
integrate well with our control plane.

lcp: Contains the Linux control-plane. This is a system for configuring
Linux to get out of the way so that whole cores can be allocated to app
Oses. It also will eventually provision resources like IO queues, memory
and cores. Probably it will include a library, a command-line tool, and a
deamon.

tools: Put benchmarks, load generators, workloads, and profiling tools
here.

A couple more documentation files are in the top-level directory.
They include the following:

LICENSE: Software license information and restrictions.
STYLE: Coding style conventions for the project.

Please read both of these before making changes to the code.

Happy Hacking!
