\subsection{Experimental setup}
\label{sec:eval:setup}

\edb{TO FIXUP once we decide final location.   Current values are for EPFL} 

Our experimental setup consists of a cluster of 19 clients and one
server connected by an XXX low-latency 10GbE switch.  The client
machines are dual Xenon XXX running at XXX Ghz with a single, Intel
XXX 10GbE NIC connecting to the switch.  The server is a dual-Xeon XXX
running at XXX Ghz with XXX GB of DRAM with four Intel XXX NICs.  Each
socket (client or server) has 8 cores and 16 hyperthreads.  When
reporting multi-core scalability, we report results with
hyperthreading enabled, and both hyperthreads of the cores are used.

The server is connected to
the switch via a 4x10GbE bond configured in as a L2+L3
hash~\cite{missing} in the switch via LACP~\cite{ieee802.3ad}.  Jumbo
frames are never enabled.  Our baseline configuration in each machine
is the Ubuntu XXX distribution running the XXX Linux kernel.  Although
the server has two sockets, our experiments pin IRQs, processes, and
the IX dataplane onto a single socket and use memory from that socket;
all NICs are attached to that socket via the PCIe root complex.

\subsection{Handling short TCP transactions}

\input{figs/float-short}

We first evaluate \ix's scalability with a benchmark that stresses
connection churn in server, as used to evaluate
Megapipe~\cite{han2012megapipe} and mTCP~\cite{jeong2014mtcp}:
multiple clients connect to a single server listeningo on a single
port, send a request of size $s$ and wait for an echo of a message of
the same size.  As with netpipe, while accepting the message, the server holds off its
echo response until the message has been entirely received.
Each client performs this synchronous remote procedure
call $n$ times, and then close the connection using a reset
(\texttt{TCP RST}).

Fig.~\ref{fig:short} shows the results. XXX


\subsection{TODO}

\todo Compare apples-to-apples with Megapipe, and mTCP in terms of microbenchmarks.

\todo Baseline comparison of state-of-the art systems include:  Linux (some recent version, with SO\_REUSEPORT); Megapipe (if possible), mTCP (if possible). 

\todo Microbenchmark: short TCP transactions (echo server, as defined in megapipe).   Goal is to beat mTCP (and therefore all others) hands down.

\todo Benchmark: memcached - compare with FB results (?)

\todo Benchmark: lightttpd -- used by Affinity-Accept and mTCP.  

\todo ngnx: an actually used webserver.
