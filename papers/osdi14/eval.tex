\label{sec:eval}

We compared \ix to the Linux baseline running a 3.11.10 kernel, and to
mTCP We evaluate the scalability of \ix and compare it to the Linux
baseline running a 3.11.10 kernel and to mTCP~\cite{jeong2014mtcp}. 
Our evalution uses both networking microbenchmarks and a real-world,
massively deployed, event-based application. 

% We
% selected mTCP as it is the state-of-the-art user-space TCP alternative
% available on the same hardware.  We first
% describe the experimental setup (\S\ref{sec:eval:setup}).  We then
% characterize the performance using a series of micro-benchmark against

% then scale the latter test to a server with 4x10GbE of connectivity
% and use that infrastructure to characterize \ix's scalability in
% handling large persistent connections (\S\ref{sec:eval:scale}).
% Finally, we characterize the performance of the \ix system by running

% (\S\ref{sec:eval:memcached}).


\subsection{Experimental Methodology}
\label{sec:eval:setup}

We use two experimental setups because we wish to simulanteously
compare with mTCP and scale to bandwidth beyond 10GbE.  Unfortunately,
our 4x10GbE setup uses recent hardware not support by mTCP out of the
box~\footnote{We were able to port mTCP to the 4x10GbE setup, but
  could not reach the expected performance.  We will attempt to unify
  the setup by the camera-ready deadline.}. Linux and \ix run on both
setups.

%  more recent hardware that does not run mTCP out
% of the box.  We therefore used a \emph{10GbE setup} for
% \S\ref{sec:eval:netpipe} and \S\ref{sec:eval:short} and includes mTCP
% results. The \emph{4x10GbE setup} is used for
% \S\ref{sec:eval:short40}, \S\ref{sec:eval:scale} and
% \S\ref{sec:eval:memcached} and compares \ix and Linux~\footnote{We
%   were able to port mTCP to the 4x10GbE setup, but could not reproduce
%   the expected performance.  We will attempt to unify the setup by the
%   camera-ready deadline.}


%\george{possible false hope that mTCP can use 4 NICs. I am not sure about that.}}.

 
\myparagraph{10GbE setup:} \edb{PLACEHOLDER:} This setup consists of a
cluster of XX Xeon XXX @ XXX Ghz machine with Intel 82599EB 10GbE NICs,
connected with an Arista XXX switch. One machine is used as the
server, while the rest can be used as clients. The server socket has 6
cores and 12 hyperthreads.

\myparagraph{4x10GbE setup:} This setup consists of a cluster of 19
clients and one server connected by an HP 5820AF-24XG 10GbE switch.
The client machines are a mix of Xeon E5-2637 @ 3.5 Ghz and Xeon
E5-2650 @ 2.6 Ghz.  Each client has a single 82599EB 10GbE NIC
connecting to the switch.  The server is a Xeon E5-2665 @ 2.4 Ghz with
256 GB of DRAM and four Intel 2P X520 NICs.  Each client or server
socket has has 8 cores and 16 hyperthreads.  The server is connected
to the switch via a 4x10GbE bond configured as a L2+L3 hash.

\myparagraph{Common elements:} Our baseline configuration in each
machine is the Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS distribution running the 3.11.10
Linux kernel.  When reporting multi-core scalability, we report
results on a per-core basis with hyperthreading enabled.  Except for
\S\ref{sec:eval:netpipe}, client machines always run Linux. All power
management features are disabled for all systems in all
experiments. Jumbo frames are never enabled.

% Although the servers have two sockets, our
% experiments use only the CPU and memory resources of the socket to
% which the NIC are attached.  \edb{CONTREVERSIAL: We made this
%   deliberate decision to eliminate NUMA imbalances from our
%   experiments, and to most closely reproduce the setup used in
%   ~\cite{jeong2014mtcp}}

The Linux client and server implementations of our benchmarks use the
\texttt{libevent} framework with the \texttt{epoll} system call.  We
downloaded and installed mTCP from the public-domain
realease~\cite{url:mtcp}, but had to write the benchmarks ourselves
using the mTCP API.  To run mTCP, we switch to the 2.6.36 kernel, as
this is the most recent supported kernel version.

\subsection{Latency and Single-flow Bandwidth}
\label{sec:eval:netpipe}

We first evaluated the latency of \ix using NetPIPE, a popular
ping-pong benchmark, using our 10GbE setup.  NetPIPE simply exchanges
a fixed-size message between two servers and helps calibrate the
latency and bandwdith of a single-flow~\cite{snell1996netpipe}.  In
all cases, the two servers use the same system (Linux, mTCP, or \ix).

%%%
%%% Numbers for latency
%% IX-IX missing
%% Linux-Linux (20.95us 
%% Linux-mTCP (86.77us)
%% mTCP-mTCP (95.53us)

Fig.~\ref{fig:pingpong} shows the goodput achieved for NetPIPE for
different message sizes.  Two \ix servers achieve goodput of 5Gbps
(half of the maximum) with messages as small as \edb{32KB}. In
contrast, mTCP requires \edb{400KB} messages to achieve 5Gbps, while
Linux requires messages larger than 500KB. The goodput difference
between the three systems is most dramatic for small messages. Using
64B messages, the one-way latency is 6.1\microsecond between two
servers running \ix, 21\microsecond if they are running Linux, and
95\microsecond if they are running mTCP.  The differences in system
architecture explain such the dramatic gap. \ix has a dataplane model
that polls queues and runs them to completion. Linux has an interrupt
model, which wakes up the blocked process. mTCP uses aggressive
batching to offset the cost of context switching~\cite{jeong2014mtcp}.
Nevertheless, even with high message sizes, \ix maintains a \edb{2x}
and \edb{3x} goodput advantage over mTCP and Linux respectively.

\subsection{Scalability and High Connection Churn}
\label{sec:eval:short}

\input{figs/float-short40}

Next, we evaluate \ix's multi-core scalability in handling workloads
with extreme connection churn by using the same benchmark used to
evaluate Megapipe~\cite{han2012megapipe} and
mTCP~\cite{jeong2014mtcp}. Multiple clients connect to a single server
listening on a single port, send a request of size $s$ and wait for an
echo of a message of the same size.  As with NetPIPE, while accepting
the message, the server holds off its echo response until the message
has been entirely received.  Each client performs this synchronous
remote procedure call $n$ times, and then close the connection using a
reset (\texttt{TCP RST}).

%% RAW DATA - 1024 message per connection
%% IX:  7074246
%% mTCP: 3253521

\christos{in figure 4, the core count for b and c is core = 6}

\myparagraph{10GbE results:} Fig.~\ref{fig:short10} shows the results
on the 10GbE setup.  For Linux and mTCP, our results are consistent
with the ones published in the mTCP paper~\cite{jeong2014mtcp}.  For
all three tests (core scaling, message count scaling, message size
scaling), \ix scales linearly much better and is quickly able to
sature the hardware resources.  When reaching saturation, it is never
CPU-bound, and appears to be limited by the NIC packet per second
hardware limit (Fig.~\ref{fig:short10:mcore}) or Ethernet wire rates
limitations (Fig.~\ref{fig:short10:size}).  In constast, mTCP needs
all 6 cores to match the rate on Fig.~\ref{fig:short10:mcore}, and
delivers 46\% of the throughput of \ix on
Fig.~\ref{fig:short10:roundtrips}.  Linux is never able to match \ix
or mTCP on any configuration.


%\subsection{High connection churn at 4x10GbE}
%\label{sec:eval:short40}

\myparagraph{40GbE results:} Fig.~\ref{fig:short40} shows the results
on the 4x10GbE setup for Linux and \ix, as well as an \ix
configuration that uses only one of the four
links. Fig.~\ref{fig:short40:mcore} shows that \ix linearly scales and
delivers 3.9MTPS on 4x10GbE with a single socket.
Fig.~\ref{fig:short40:roundtrips} shows that going to 4x10GbE also
improves throughput, but only by 30\%--\edb{WHY?}.  Finally,
Fig.\ref{fig:short40:size} shows that \ix can deliver 8KB messages
with a goodput of 35Gbps, for a wire throughput of 38Gpbs (out of a
possible 39.7Gbps).  Overall, \ix makes it practical to scale
protected TCP/IP processing beyond 10GbE, even with a single
multi-core server.


\subsection{Connection Scalability}

\label{sec:eval:scale}

We now evaluate \ix's scalability when handling a large number of
concurrent connections. In this benchmark, each client machine runs
$n$ threads, with each thread independently performing a 64B remote
procedure call to the server.  Each RPC randomly chooses among $m$
open sockets to perform the RPC.  In our setup with 19 clients, the
server must multiplex among $19 \times n \times m$ open connections.
We experimentally set $n \leq 24$ to maximize throughput.  We report
the maximal throughput in messages per second for varying number of
total established connections. 

%Connection scaling IX/Linux @ 40Gbe 
%12036405.031689
%915256.419191
%/p
%13.15085

Fig.~\ref{fig:connscaling} shows the results.  We show results going
to 100,000 connections as our experimental setup is limited by the
client machines's own abilities to handle larger connections counts.
As expected, throughput increases with the degree of concurrency, but
then decreases with increasing number of connections due to the
increasingly high cost of multiplexing among open connections.  At the
peak, \ix performs 13x better than Linux, consistent with the results
from Fig.~\ref{fig:short40:roundtrips}.  With 100,000 connections and
4x10GbE, \ix is able to deliver 52\% of its own peak throughput.
