\subsection{Experimental setup}
\label{sec:eval:setup}


\todo Compare apples-to-apples with Megapipe, and mTCP in terms of microbenchmarks.

\todo Baseline comparison of state-of-the art systems include:  Linux (some recent version, with SO\_REUSEPORT); Megapipe (if possible), mTCP (if possible). 

\todo Microbenchmark: short TCP transactions (echo server, as defined in megapipe).   Goal is to beat mTCP (and therefore all others) hands down.

\todo Benchmark: memcached - compare with FB results (?)

\todo Benchmark: lightttpd -- used by Affinity-Accept and mTCP.  

\todo ngnx: an actually used webserver.
