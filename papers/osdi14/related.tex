\section{Related Work}

We organize the discussion topically, by first discussing prior work
that inspired our key design decisions (\S\ref{sec:design}) and then
the alternative approaches to solving the scalability challenges of
web-scale applications, while avoiding redundant commentary already
exposed in (\S\ref{sec:motivation:current}.


\paragraph{Separation of control and data plane.}

The notion of architected separation between control and data plane is
pervasise in networking protocols (e.g., BPG/OSFP vs. LPM- for
routing) as it has allowed each to scale independently of each other.
In systems, virtualization also separates the control and execution
functions; type I hypervisors the control plane operates within a
customized environment (e.g., Xen's
dom0~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/BarhamDFHHHN03}) whereas the control plane
of type II hypervisors runs as process on top of a commodity operating
system~\cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/BugnionDRSW12}.  Recently,
Arrakis~\cite{peter2013arrakis,arrakisTR13} proposes to separate the
networking stack into a distinct dataplane.  Our work most closely
ressembles Arrakis, but with noticeable differences: Arrakis uses the
Barrelfish multikernel as its control plane, whereas our work suggests
that Linux using the Dune framework~\cite{belay2012dune} is an
appropriate foundation.  \edb{TODO -- comparison with Arrakis}.
