\label{sec:related}

We organize the discussion topically, while avoiding redundancy with
the commentary in \S\ref{sec:motivation:current}.

\myparagraph{Virtualization hardware:} Hardware support for
virtualization naturally separates control and execution functions,
e.g., to build type-2 hypervisors
~\cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/BugnionDRSW12,misc/kivity07kvm}, run virtual
appliances~\cite{DBLP:conf/lisa/SapuntzakisBCZCLR03}, or processes
with access to privileged instructions~\cite{dune}.
Arrakis~\cite{arrakis-osdi} uses virtualization
hardware and the Barrelfish multikernel for
control~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/BaumannBDHIPRSS09}, sharing a similar
separation of the dataplane from the control plane. \ix differs in
that it uses Linux for control, isolates the control plane, the
dataplane and applications through Dune, and has a different execution
model built around adaptive batching and run to completion.


\myparagraph{Library operating systems:} Exokernels proposed to
implement system abstractions via library operating systems linked in
with applications~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/EnglerKO95}, extending the
end-to-end principle to resource
management~\cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/SaltzerRC84}.  Library operating
systems typically run as virtual machines
~\cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/BugnionDGR97}, e.g. to deploy cloud services
~\cite{DBLP:conf/asplos/MadhavapeddyMRSSGSHC13}. \ix limits itself to
the implementation of the protocol stack, allowing applications to
implement their own resource management policies, e.g. via the
\texttt{libevent} compatibility layer.

\myparagraph{User-level networking stacks:} User-level network
stacks~\cite{jeong2014mtcp, sandstorm, openonload} can
outperform kernel-based implementations through specialization and
elimination of redundant layers and abstractions, but trade-off
performance for a weaker security model.  The \ix dataplane
demonstrates that a specialized networking stack can offer performance
and cooperate with applications without having to weaken security and
isolation properties.
 
\myparagraph{Hardware and protocol specialization:} Applications can
use a connection-less UDP-based protocol for
scalability~\cite{DBLP:conf/nsdi/NishtalaFGKLLMPPSSTV13}.  Latency-sensitive datacenter
applications can use specialized Infiniband adapters to expose RDMA
with $1-3$\microsecond latencies to
applications~\cite{dragojevic14farm,DBLP:conf/icpp/JoseSLZHWIOWSP11, mitchell:rdma, DBLP:conf/sosp/OngaroRSOR11}.
Specialized FGPAs can replace conventional servers for important
applications such as
memcached~\cite{DBLP:conf/hotcloud/BlottKLVBI13,DBLP:conf/fpga/ChalamalasettiLWARM13,HPHA:Tanaka:2014}.
\ix is designed to allow TCP/IP to scale with architectural trends by
eliminating kernel bottlenecks.

\myparagraph{Asynchronous and zero-copy interactions:} 
Systems with asynchronous, batched, or exception-less system calls
substantially reduce the overheads associated with frequent kernel
transitions and context switches~\cite{DBLP:conf/osdi/HanMCR12,jeong2014mtcp,DBLP:journals/cacm/Rizzo12,DBLP:conf/osdi/SoaresS10}.
Zero-copy reduces data movement overheads and simplifies resource
management~\cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/PaiDZ00}, e.g., using page remapping and COW~\cite{DBLP:conf/usenix/Chu96}.
\ix's use of adaptive,
bounded batching is suitable for both low-latency and high-message
rate, and its safe, cooperative memory management model enables
zero-copy at the application level without page remapping.
