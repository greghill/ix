We thank the reviewers, and will take all comments to heart. 
We agree that the writing can be much improved in form and
substance.


Design

 -[#B}Prior work inspired many elements of our design (batching,
  run-to-completion, flow-consistent hashing, and zero-copy). Unique to IX,
  we show how to bring all four together in a full TCP stack running an
  untrusted application with a novel user/kernel execution model.
  The way we batch is also unique: (i) adaptively based on congestion,
  and therefore without impacting latency (ii) in each step of the
  processing pipeline instead of a single phase (such as the system call
  boundary[73]).
\adam{this is my take at contributions, reviewer called our system a mashup, so not sure if this is the right approach. Can we say
combining these design elements together makes the system more than the sum of it's parts? What was really hard with IX was getting
these concepts to compose together nicely. That being said, all previous systems either miss one of the concepts or apply one of
the concepts incorrectly or apply the concepts to something trivially easy like UDP, including Sandstorm, mTCP, and Arrakis}
 
 - ADD STATEMENT ABOUT CONTRIBUTIONS | WHY AN EVOLUTIONARY DESIGN NOT ENOUGH
\adam{Many concepts from IX could be applied to Linux. Some like flow-consistent hashing already have been in Megapipe and Affinity Accept.
Run to completion and batching would be very hard because it would be retrofitting a new execution model on an existing OS}

 -[#A,#C]Our design partitions NIC queues and cores between IX
  instances.  IX is not designed to run within a VM which is 
  actually ok as most large website (Google, Facebook, Twitter,…)
  don't use VMs for webscale workloads.

 -[#C]RSS only dictates the behavior of RX packets; TX packets can be
  sent on any queue.  For incoming connections, the RSS hash
  determines the core.  For outgoing connections, the ephemeral
  port is selected so that the RSS hash affinitizes to the core that
  opened the connection.

 - ADD STATEMENT ABOUT PROTECTION
\adam{would need to discuss IOMMU's, SRIOV, the fact that storage is soon multiqueue. It's hard in 500 words}


Comparison 

 - [#A]netmap is a raw Ethernet packet system, and therefore can't
   directly run a TCP-based workload.

 - [#E]We compare thoroughly with mTCP in our evaluation; the limitation
   described in the footnote is specific to our 4x10GbE configuration,
   for which mTCP could not run correctly without non-trivial source
   modifications.

 - [#E]The Megapipe source code is not readily available on the web,
   so our comparison with Megapipe is "transitive": [36] shows that
   mTCP clearly outperforms megapipe, and IX outperforms mTCP.

 - [#A]We'd be excited to compare against Arrakis. It was not
   available at time of submission.

Evaluation:

 - [#A]The half-ticks in Fig 4(a) and 4(b) correspond to
   hyperthreads. We enabled hyperthreading only when it
   improved performance. With mTCP, each app hyperthread
   is paired with network stack hyperthread (by design).
   We stopped scaling on 1x10GbE with a few cores because
   we saturated the NIC. 4x10GbE demonstrates our stack
   can go beyond a single NIC.

 - [#C] We have measured 99th latency for memcached and will add
   it to the graph.  IX compares even more favorably to Linux on the
   99th than on the 95th.

 - [#D]We aggressively tuned Linux e.g. pinning threads to cores, 
   killing background tasks, adjusting interrupt steering, applying 
   custom parameters to the NIC driver, and running a very recent kernel 
   (further suggestions welcomed). This had a huge impact over untuned 
   results.
\adam{impossible to compare numbers with 500 word limit, different # of cores, different setups, different workloads}

 - [#E]We are actively looking at behavior of multiple sockets. Our
   initial focus was to deliver line rate (10 and 4x10GbE) using a
   single socket.  

Networking behavior:

 - [#A]TSO cannot improve small-message performance. When
   streaming, IX is optimized enough to easily achieve
   line-rate, even without TSO. Intel's implementations of RSC does not
   scale to large flow counts and adds latency.

 - [#B]ECN/RED traffic engineering: Yes, IX's adaptive,
   run-to-completion model ensures that receive queues build up only
   at the NIC edge, before processing.  Step (1) of Fig 2 can be
   modeled as a software router from which batches of packets are
   delivered.  This papers focuses on system comparison using
   "standard" networking protocols.
\adam{they specifically asked if we could evaluate this in the camera ready}
