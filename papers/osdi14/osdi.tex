%% Submission requirements
%% 12 pages + plus as many pages as needed for references.

%% Blind reviewing of full papers will be done by the program committee
%% and external review committee, with limited use of outside
%% referees. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their
%% submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly
%% or by implication (e.g., through the references or
%% acknowledgments). Submissions violating the detailed formatting and
%% anonymization rules will not be considered for publication.
