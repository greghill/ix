We now validate the performance benefits of the protected dataplane
design on memcached -- a real world, massively deployed, in-memory
key-value store built on top of the libevent framework.  We use the
mutilate~\cite{url:mutilate} load-generator to measure median and 95th
percentile latency as a function of the throughput delivered by the
server~\cite{Leverich:RHSU:2014}. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:mutilate} reports the latencies as a function of the
number of queries per second for synthetic workloads modelled after
Facebook's \texttt{ETC} and \texttt{USR} workloads~\cite{Atikoglu:2012:WAL}.

\edb{PLACEHOLDER} The peak QPS is measured using \ix at
XXX, which maps to a bandwidth leaving the server of XXX Gbps, or XX\%
of the theoretical wire rate of the machine.  We report the numbers
for Linux and \ix for XXX and YYY established, concurrent
connections served by the 18 clients.

Our results show that \edb{TODO}.....
