\section{\ix Design Approach}
\label{sec:design}

% We now present the fundamental design principles of a dataplane
% architecture designed to run untrusted, event-driven applicatxions, and
% designed to address the specific scalability challenges of today's
% web-scale applications.

The first three requirements of \S\ref{sec:motivation:challenges} --
high packet rate, microsecond latency, and connection scalability---
are not unique to event-driven, web-scale applications.  These
requirements are reasonably well understood and have been addressed in
the design of middleboxes such as firewalls~\cite{missing},
load-balancers~\cite{missing}, and software
routers~\cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/KohlerMCJK00,DBLP:conf/sosp/DobrescuEACFIKMR09};
by integrating the networking stack and the application into a single
\emph{dataplane}. The two remaining requirements, resource elasticity
and protection, are not addressed for such middleboxes because they
are single-purpose systems, not exposed directly to users. 

% As for the other two remaining aspects -- resource elasticity and
% security and protection --, middleboxes provide fewer insights: since
% each middlebox typically performs a single function, resource
% elasticity and proportionality is less of a direct concern.  They are
% traditionally deployed and maintained using an embedded paradigm in
% which the entire stack -- operating system, applications and utilities
% -- is packaged as single blob.  As such, the security and protection
% model is not directly exposed to users.

Dataplanes differ from a traditional OS designs in two fundamental
ways. First, they are designed to \emph{run each packet to
  completion}. All protocol and application processing for a packet is
done before moving on to the next packet.  In contrast, a commodity OS is designed
with protocol processing decoupled from the application itself in
order to enable flexibility in terms of resource scheduling and flow
control. For example, a commodity OS relies on device and soft interrupts to context switch from application processing to protocol processing; 
similarily, the OS will return \texttt{ACK} and
slide its receive window even though the application is not consuming
data, up to some extent. Second, dataplanes are designed to operate in
a \emph{flow-consistent, coherence-free, flow-consistent} manner.
Network flows are distributed into distinct queues via receive-side
scaling (RSS)~\cite{DBLP:journals/computer/RegnierMIIMHNCF04} and each queue
is served by a single core so that the common case processing of a
packet requires no synchronization or cache coherence interactions
between cores.

% Flow-consistency distributes flows
% into distinct queues based on a L4-hash; this is routinely supported
% in network CPUs used in middleboxes (e.g., ~\cite{cavium-octeon}) as
% well as commodity NIC via Receive Side Scaling (RSS)~\cite{missing}.

Building upon the lessons from middleboxes, we design \ix to answer
the following question: {\it can the dataplane architecture be
  efficiently extended to support untrusted, event-driven applications
  and satisfy simultaneously the five requirements of
  \S\ref{sec:motivation:challenges}?}  The answer relies on the
following key design principles:


\myparagraph{Separation of control and data plane:} 
% Software dataplanes are designed to operate on flows, not to
% provision resources or manage them in an elastic and proportional
% manner.
Our design separates the control function, responsible for resource
configuration, provisioning, scheduling, and monitoring, from the
dataplane, which runs the networking stack and application logic.
Like a conventional OS, our control plane multiplexes and schedule
resources among dataplanes but in an coarse-grain manner in space and
time: cores are dedicated to applications until revoked; memory is
allocated in GB chunks; hardware queues are exclusively assigned to a
single dataplane for long time periods. Each dataplane instance
supports one, single address-space, application.  This is similar to
the Exokernel approach of using library operating
systems~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/EnglerKO95}, but we offer protection
between applications and the control plane using the ubiquitous
available hardware virtualization features in modern
servers~\cite{DBLP:journals/computer/UhligNRSMABKLS05,belay2012dune}.
\christos{should we say here that Linux is the control plane or leave
  it for 4?}

\myparagraph{Native zero-copy, event-oriented API:} Our dataplane does not
expose or emulate the POSIX API.  Instead, it exposes a native
event-oriented API that meets the commutativity
rule~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/ClementsKZMK13}. Similar to Megapipe's
lwsockets, each hardware thread has a pair of in-memory command and
completion rings, used to communicate between the dataplane and the
application. The API allows for a true zero-copy operation in both the
receive and transfer directions by having the dataplane and the
application cooperatively manage the \texttt{mbuf} buffer pool.  All
incoming packets are stored in \texttt{mbufs}, which are mapped
read-only into the application. Applications may hold onto mbufs and
return them to the kernel at a later point.  Similarly, the
application may send to the dataplane scatter/gather lists of mbufs
for transmission. As the contents are not copied, the application must
keep the content immutable until reception is acknowledged.  We also
support a libevent compatibility mode for legacy
applications. Unfortunately, libevent assumes a different memory
allocation model and true zero-copy is not possible in this case.


% Many event-driven applications rely on the libevent framework, which
% creates an OS-independent level of abstraction for Linux, *BSD and
% Windows capable of using the native, scalable APIs of these operating
% systems, such as \texttt{epoll} and Windows IO Completion ports. 


\myparagraph{Run to completion with adaptive batching:} Our dataplane 
runs to completion all pipeline stages needed to receive or transmit a
packet, intermixing protocol processing and application logic as
needed. Hence, there is no need for intermediate buffering between
pipeline stages or between the application logic and network protocol
stack. Since there is no socket layer at all, flow control is directly
but safely exposed to the architecture, especially for outgoing
packets (see \texttt{mbufs} discussion  above).

We minimize overheads by processing packets in bounded batches.
Unlike previous proposals that batch only at the API level in order to
amortize system call overhead~\cite{jeong2014mtcp,han2012megapipe}, we
execute every pipeline stage on a small batch of packets or commands
in order to fully amortize instruction caching effects and the
overhead of PCIe transfers. To minimize the impact on latency, we
adaptively batch and only in the presence of backlogs. We
experimentally find that batching up to a dozen \christos{check}
packets introduces negligible jitter and is sufficient to amortize all
per-packet overheads.


\myparagraph{Flow consistent, coherence-free processing:} We use multi-queue
NICs with RSS support to provide flow-consistent hashing of incoming
traffic to distinct hardware queues. Each queue is served by a single
hardware thread all the way to the application layer, eliminating the
need for synchronization and cache coherence traffic between
cores. Similarly, memory management is organized in distinct pools for
each hardware thread. The absence of a socket layer eliminates the
issue of the shared file descriptor namespace in multithreaded applications~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/ClementsKZMK13}. Hence,
our design scales well with the increasing number of cores in modern
servers. Our approach does not restrict the memory model for
applications. Application logic can take advantage of coherent, shared
memory to exchange information and synchronize between cores. For
instance, this may be needed if the application must combine
information arriving from multiple network flows.

% \christos{seems like an implementation detail to me}
%The approach extends to link-aggregation bonds to scale to multiple links.


\myparagraph{Buffering at the NIC edge:} Since there is no
intermediate buffering within the dataplane pipeline, buffering and
therefore congestion will occur only at the NIC edge for incoming
packets before they are processed and for outgoing packets before they
are sent on the wire.  In effect, the NIC edge acts like the last-hop
buffer in the network.  Like switches and routers, the NIC edge can
monitor queue depths to detect congestion, signal the control plane to
allocate additional resources (more hardware threads, increase clock
frequency) for the dataplane, notify explicity flow sources of
congestion via ECN~\cite{ramakrishnan2001addition}, and finally make
policy decisions on when and how to drop packets when buffers run
low~\cite{DBLP:journals/ton/FloydJ93}.
