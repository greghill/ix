\section{Design Principles}

\input{figs/float-queues-cores}

\todo Separation of control and data planes.  We use Linux with
real-time priority processes; ensure that interrupts are not directed
to the DP cores (or at least not that much).  Communication mechanism
between control plane and data plane using shared memory (for data)
and sockets (to signal and sleep/wakeup).


\todo Coherency-free operations  (ala multikernel~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/BaumannBDHIPRSS09})

\todo Dynamic spinning cores : re-define pthread abstraction but use it in a different way

\todo Asynchronous channels (like Megapipe)

\todo Abstraction layers: libevent, libpcap


\section{Implementation}

\input{figs/float-cp-dp}
\input{figs/float-queue-takeover}

\todo System Archictecture (Dune~\cite{belay2012dune})

\todo Driver layer

\todo TODO (figures, ...)

\section{Evaluation}


\todo Compare apples-to-apples with Megapipe, and mTCP in terms of microbenchmarks.

\todo Baseline comparison of state-of-the art systems include:  Linux (some recent version, with SO\_REUSEPORT); Megapipe (if possible), mTCP (if possible). 

\todo Microbenchmark: short TCP transactions (echo server, as defined in megapipe).   Goal is to beat mTCP (and therefore all others) hands down.

\todo Benchmark: memcached - compare with FB results (?)

\todo Benchmark: lightttpd -- used by Affinity-Accept and mTCP.  

\todo ngnx: an actually used webserver.


\section{Discussion}

\section{Related Work}

\todo need a table that compares us with related work (!)

\todo Improving operating system kernels to scale

\todo Limitations of the POSIX socket API

\todo User-level networking

\todo Protocol offload engines

\todo Energy-proportionality.   Have a graph that shows the energy-proportionality of a dynamic core approach.
