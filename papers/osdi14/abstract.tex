\begin{abstract}

  Web-scale applications are placing aggressive demands on the TCP/IP
  stack implementation in modern systems, such as high packet rates
  for small messages, microsecond-scale tail latency, support for
  hundreds of thousands of connections, and elastic use of system
  resources. The conventional wisdom is that such requirements are
  best addressed outside the operating system, in a user-level
  implementation of the networking stack.

  We present \ix, a {\it dataplane operating system} specifically
  designed for web-scale, event-driven applications.  The \ix
  architecture separates control plane from the dataplanes and
  provides a native, zero-copy API that explicitly exposes flow
  control to applications. However, \ix uses hardware virtualization
  to offer the same protection model as commodity operating
  systems. \ix optimizes for both bandwidth and latency by processing
  bounded batches of packets to completion and by eliminating
  coherence traffic and synchronization on multi-core systems.

  We demonstrate that \ix outperforms Linux by an order of magnitude
  for throughput and by 3x for latency. \ix also outperforms a
  state-of-the-art, user-space networking stack by up to 2.5x for
  throughput and 15x for latency. Moreover, we show that \ix
  efficiently supports a hundred thousand connections and improves the
  throughput of a massively deployed, key-value store by up to 2.7x.
