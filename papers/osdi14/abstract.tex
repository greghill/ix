  Web-scale applications are placing aggressive demands on the
  implementation of the TPC/IP networking stack in modern systems,
  such as high packet rates, microsecond-scale tail latencies, support
  for hundreds of thousands of connections, and elastic use of system
  resources. The conventional wisdom is that such requirements are
  best addressed outside the operating system, in a user-level
  implentation of networking stack.

  We present {\it IX}, a {\it dataplane operating system} specifically
  designed for web-scale, event-driven applications.  The IX
  architecture separates control plane from the dataplanes and
  provides a native, zero-copy API that explicitly exposes flow
  control to applications. However, IX uses hardware virtualization to
  offer the same protection model as commodity operating systems. IX
  optimizes for both bandwidth and latency by processing bounded
  batches of packets to completion and by eliminating coherence
  traffic and synchronization on multi-core hardware. 

  We demonstrate that IX outperforms Linux by X for packet rate and by
  Y for latency. IX also outperforms a state-of-the-art, user-space
  networking stack by  X for packet rate and by Y for latency. We also
  show that IX efficiently supports Z connections and improve the
  overall performance of real-world applications by a factor of W.
