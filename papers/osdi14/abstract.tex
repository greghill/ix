\begin{abstract}

  Web-scale applications are placing aggressive demands on the
  implementation of the TCP/IP networking stack in modern systems,
  such as high packet rates for small messages, microsecond-scale tail
  latency, support for hundreds of thousands of connections, and
  elastic use of system resources. The conventional wisdom is that
  such requirements are best addressed outside the operating system,
  in a user-level implementation of the networking stack.

  We present \ix, a {\it dataplane operating system} specifically
  designed for web-scale, event-driven applications.  The \ix
  architecture separates control plane from the dataplanes and
  provides a native, zero-copy API that explicitly exposes flow
  control to applications. However, \ix uses hardware virtualization to
  offer the same protection model as commodity operating systems. \ix
  optimizes for both bandwidth and latency by processing bounded
  batches of packets to completion and by eliminating coherence
  traffic and synchronization on multi-core systems. 

  \christos{fix} We demonstrate that \ix outperforms Linux by X for packet rate and by
  Y for latency. \ix also outperforms a state-of-the-art, user-space
  networking stack by X for packet rate and by Y for
  latency. Moreover, we show that \ix efficiently supports Z
  connections and improves the overall performance of real-world
  applications by a factor of W.
