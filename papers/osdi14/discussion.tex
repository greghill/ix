\label{sec:disc}

% We now discuss a number of important lessons, design issues, and
% limitations of the current \ix implementation.

\myparagraph{What makes \ix faster:} The results in \S\ref{sec:eval}
show that a networking stack can be implemented in a protected OS
kernel and still deliver wire-rate performance for most benchmarks.
The tight coupling of the dataplane architecture, using only a minimal
amount of batching to amortize transition costs, causes application
logic to be scheduled at the right time, which is essential for
latency-sensitive workloads.  Therefore, the benefits of \ix go beyond
just minimizing kernel overheads. Similar to
Exokernel~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/EnglerKO95}, the lack of intermediate
buffers pushes all abstractions outside of the OS kernel, allowing for
efficient, application-specific implementations.  In particular, the
zero-copy approach helps even when the user-level libraries add a
level of copying, as it is the case for compatibility interfaces in
our event library.  The extra copy occurs much closer to the actual
use, thereby increasing cache locality.  Finally, we took great care
in tuning the implementation of \ix for multi-core scalability,
eliminating constructs that introduce synchronization or coherence
traffic.

% \myparagraph{Selecting \ix's TCP stack:} 
% The \ix kernel includes a complete network protocol stack with
% RFC-compliant support for TCP, UDP, ARP, ICMP and LACP.  It however
% explicitly lacks a complete IP-layer and is therefore only a capable
% networking endpoint, but not of handling routing, bridging or
% filtering functions.  It also totally lacks a socket layer and its
% associated API and semantics.  For our implementation of TCP, we chose
% to lwIP~\cite{dunkels2001design} as a starting point for our code base because of its
% modularity and is maturity as a compliant, feature-rich networking
% stack.  lwIP was however designed with memory-efficiency in mind,
% primarily for embedded environments.  We radically changed the data
% structures that organize protocol control blocks for scalability, as
% well as for finer-grain, precise timer management.  However, we did
% not (yet) attempt to optimize the code paths for performance, and
% consequently believe that our results have room for improvement.

% \myparagraph{Challenges in API design:} We iterated through many
% designs for the \ix dataplane API in an effort to support simple, high
% performance, flexible, and secure IO at user-level.  Batched system
% calls, in particular, were a challenge to support correctly. In an
% early design of \ix we ommited return codes from batched system calls,
% instead opting to make the outcome of every operation be an event
% condition. However, we discovered that the undefined order of event
% condition delivery created uneccesary complexity. For example, if a
% sent event condition is delivered before the status of the previous
% sendv system call was provided, then it was difficult for our event
% library to determine which pending data in the send window should be
% enqueued next. We fixed this issue by handling system call return
% codes seperately from event conditions. In our final design, the
% kernel overwrites user memory containing batched system call requests
% with corresponding return codes. We also discovered that we could
% improve performance and error handling simplicity in our event libary
% by issuing a single sendv system call per flow for each processing
% round. Thus, if an application requests more than one write IO, we'll
% coalesce them into a single system call.

% \todo Lessons learned: importance of hardware knobs and
% micro-architectural effects.  \christos{should we get into that? at
%   least say that this will be better with Hasswell, more cores, better
%   nics. the trends are in our favor}

\myparagraph{Limitations of current prototype:} The current prototype
supports any stateless offload NIC with multiple queues and RSS
support. The NICs we currently use support RSS group of 16 queues,
which is inadequate given current multi-core trends. Nevertheless, the
trend in NICs seems to be towards support for larger number of
queues~\cite{radhakrishnan2014senic}. We also plan to explore using Intel's Flow
Director~\cite{intel:82599} to provide connection
affinity~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosys/PesterevSZM12} as an alternative to
our current flow hashing implementation. Our current implementation
does not exploit IOMMUs or VT-d. Instead, it uses Dune to map
descriptor rings directly into \ix memory as a form of
paravirtualization~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/BarhamDFHHHN03}.  Although
this choice puts some level of trust into \ix, the applications remain
securely isolated. % \christos{maybe something about the packet rate
%  limitatations of nics}

\myparagraph{Future work:} This paper focused on the \ix dataplane
design. \ix is designed and implemented to support the dynamic
addition and removal of elastic threads in order to achieve energy
proportional and resource efficient computing. So far we have tested
only static configurations. In future work, we will design a dynamic
runtime that rebalances hardware queues between available elastic
threads in a manner that maintains throughput and latency constraints.
%
We will also explore the synergies between \ix and networking
protocols designed to support microsecond-level latencies and reduced
buffering characteristics of \ix deployments such as
DCTCP~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/AlizadehGMPPPSS10} and
ECN~\cite{ramakrishnan2001addition}. Finally, we will investigate \ix
implementations of alternative APIs, such as
MegaPipe~\cite{han2012megapipe}, cooperative
threading~\cite{capriccio}, and rule-based
models~\cite{stutsman_2013}.


 % Looking ahead, we envision that an
% \ix-style model may provide a higher performance alternative to the
% current OS-based and hypervisor-based implementations of virtual
% switches~\cite{openvswitch} and IP-level features (e.g., iptables).
% In particular, the security model of \ix, which enforces modularity
% without introducing noticeable overheads, appears like a great match
% to meet the protection, multi-tenancy, and scalability requirements of
% network function virtualization~\cite{etsi:NFV}.
