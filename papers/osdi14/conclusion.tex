\section{Conclusion}

We have described \ix, a dataplane operating system that leverages
hardware virtualization to separate the control plane, the \ix
dataplane instances that implement in-kernel network processing, and
the event-driven applications running on top of it.  \ix provides a
native, zero-copy API that explicitly exposes flow control to
applications. The \ix dataplane optimizes for both bandwidth and
latency by processing bounded batches of packets to completion and by
eliminating coherence traffic and synchronization on multi-core
systems. On microbenchmarks, \ix noticeably outperforms both Linux and
mTCP in terms of both latency and throughput, scales to hundreds of
active concurrent connections, and can saturate 4x10GbE configurations
using a single socket.  Finally, we show that
porting \texttt{memcached} to \ix removes kernel bottlenecks and
improves throughput by up to \data{2.7x}{4.7x}.
