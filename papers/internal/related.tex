\section{Related Systems}


\paragraph*{Exokernel}   Exokernels~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/EnglerKO95} safely expose hardware to library operating systems. 


\paragraph*{Megapipe} 
Megapipe~\cite{han2012megapipe} proposes a high-performance socket
alternative for TCP/IP based applications for scalable network
applications.  Our API is inspired by it. This is similar to
Netmap~\cite{rizzo2012netmap}, which also ping shared buffers, but is
focused on libpcap applications.

\paragraph*{Akkaris}.  Akkaris~\cite{peter2013arrakis} is the closest to us.


\section{Techniques and Concepts}

\paragraph*{Scheduler activations} 
If apps are able to yield cores, and if apps are able to
asynchronously take advantage of new cores, scheduler
activations~\cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/AndersonBLL92} seem like a
perfect mechanism to make those cores available to other processes. 
The idea never really made it into POSIX, but we can use here because the API is different. 

\paragraph*{Ballooning}.   
Ballooing was introduced for memory
management~\cite{DBLP:conf/osdi/Waldspurger02}.  The balloon keeps
track of the amount of relinquished resources.  CPU ballooning could
be used to (i) start a max core pool, and (ii) dynamically resize it
according to the SLA and the global load.

\paragraph*{Super pages}  
Direct segment mapping~\cite{DBLP:conf/isca/BasuGCHS13} proposes to
replace the traditional TLB with a dedicated direct segment.

\paragraph*{Tail latency}  
Dean and Barroso~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/DeanB13} describe the
problems associated with tail latency in web-scale services.

\paragraph*{Commutativity and scalability} 
The scalable commutativy rule~\cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/ClementsKZMK13}
states that only commutative APIs can be implemented in a truly
scalable manner; our API and our implementation should support that.
RadixVM~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosys/ClementsKZ13} provides scalable
address spaces for multithreaded applications; we address this as well.



\section{Workloads}

\paragraph*{Memcached} 
Scaling memcached at Facebook~\cite{nishtala2013scaling} required
unnatural tricks such as relying on UDP and on in-network connection
proxies to compensate for the lack of scoket scalability of Linux.
