The code in this repository is proprietary and confidential.

Please take the following precautions:

1.) Never share or post the code publicly.
2.) Never include or use GPL code or any other code with a restrictive license.
3.) Clearly mark the origin of imported code that wasn't authored internally.

One important exception is that it may be required to make certain drivers and
modules GPL. For example, it's fine to make a custom Linux kernel module GPL.
Just make sure to clearly deliniate such cases.
